                        It is a pleasure to learn that Mahatma Gandhi University has been established at Meghalaya. North-East region has always been and is an integral part 
                        of our nation. The establishment of ths University at Meg halay will benefit the people of tribal areas of the state and the region by providing them high quality education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your endeavour must be to imbibe in the students virtues such as honesty, integrity and humaneness. Besides meeting the requirements of education of students 
                        from the region, I am sure that the University will grant admission to students from other parts of the nation. This will also afford the students an 
                        opportunity to have a first-hand experience of 'Unity in Diversity' of the nation.

                        Hope that the objectives ensirined in the Prospectus of the University will adequately reflect the ideas and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi in the field of education.

                        We are witnessing a phenomenal change in the education scenario. The chance has been both in terms of the content as well as the reach. The trend has been 
                        to instill the element of excellence in every field. The beat in every field of knowledge is being made available for the progress of the country. There has 
                        been a great spurt in the number of universities and colleges catering to millions of aspirants. In fact, this has been a very crucial moment for us to taking 
                        important and far reaching derisions to provide what is much needed for the student of the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are aware of the need of our country to make her a knowledge based super power in the next decade or two. With this in view, we have stepped in to meet 
                        the present day academic milieu for the student community. The idea is to create opportunities in various fields by incorporating latest specialties of learning 
                        which would cater to the critical needs of the industry and economy. We foresee a close interaction among the universities, industries, business houses and association 
                        in modeling the content and skills. This will make education more and more vocational and skill based. This will surely result to better employability and greater 
                        productivity ultimately contributing to the nation's economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am glad to know that to cater the need, Mahatma Gandhi University has been established and University is launching Bachelor's, Master's, Research and skill 
                        development programs and I hope that this University is a step forward in the direction of imparting quality education in the upcoming fields. I am sure it will 
                        open up new vistas of academic excellence for the budding youth.

                        The enrollment ratio in higher education in India is close to 10.5% against the average International enrollment ration of 53%. 
                        It implies that 89.5% youth does not pursue higher education which is a big challenge for a highly populated and fastly developing country like India.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Government of India has targeted to increase the Gross Enrollment Ration (GER) to 25%. This implies that we need to double our capacity for higher education. 
                        Besides other steps to achieve the above, the Government of India is also planning to increase more higher education institution to achieve this target from 
                        present 25% to 40%, thus there is a need of Universities.

                        Socio-economic development of any society is the fruit of collective interventions in the Education sector. While primary and secondary levels education

                        growth of the society. One of the biggest challenges faced by institutions of higher education across globe is to design an educational structure that can 
                        withstand the ever changing socio-cultural landscapes and enable the community it is serving to march ahead well with the time. The new generation-institutions
