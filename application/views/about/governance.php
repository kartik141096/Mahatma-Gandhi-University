                Dear Achievers,
            </p> -->
            <p>
                <br>
                Dear Achievers,<br><br>
                Welcome to Mahatma Gandhi University, Meghalaya - a unique institute of professional learning and academic excellence that focuses on creating a 
                distinction between "Literacy" & "Education".
            </p>
            <p>
                Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. The purpose of education is to turn mirror of ignorance into 
                windows of opportunities. The Ministry of HRD is striving to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in the country. The GER in India is 10.5%, far 
                less than the rest of the world. Thus, our goal is to increase it by 25%. Today's scenario depicts India on the growth curve of the service industry 
                which signifies the need of skilled people as manpower in near future. Many times, this aim gets neglected as our Education Industry has now morphed 
                into a steady source of business rather than academic enlightening.
            </p>
            <p>
                A university should be a place of light, of liberty and of learning. MGU focuses on providing education to the underprivileged sections of the society 
                as we have devised compensation and scholarships to those who aspire to study but do not have the means for it. The aspiring youth who want to study and 
                create their own destiny can share their stories and mail these to me on scholarships@mgu.edu.in. My team will guide and provide them with sufficient 
                avenues for higher studies at our own cost and help them to accomplish their dreams. MGU is an expansion of service industry. Serving the society is our 
                utmost priority and thus, we believe in "Education for All" approach. We provide our students with study materials, e-books and audio-visual aids for better 
                understanding of the subject at lesser cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my educational journey, the only factor which defines success is "KNOWLEDGE." It is with this idea that I, with due honour and respect envisage 
                Mahatma Gandhi University as a pinnacle institution for sharing and spreading knowledge. I always assure that my personal intervention and continuous support 
                will help the young blood in designing their career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                I welcome and invite every young aspirant, inquisitive mind and dreamer to join MGU, Meghalaya and experience the thrill of soaring high and even higher!!
            </p>
